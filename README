As part of my learning Rust, I thought I'd impement a few small unix tools.

A list of 9base tools is at http://tools.suckless.org/9base and serves as
a possible list of things to implement.

Busybox's list of commands is at http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html

Implemented:
hello: Hello, World
echo: Echos its arguments
cat: Concatenate files
seq: print a sequence of numbers
